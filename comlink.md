## Comlink: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Comlink app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Scott Atkins. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license.  The app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.  I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect ANY data, personal or not.  Only if the app crashes would data ever be collected, and this is done automatically by Android & Google.

If you have any security vulnerability concerns or have any questions whatsoever, please send me an email and I will do my best to help.
